    <!--<p id="statement">My practice involves the exploration of the human psyche with technology. To explore the relationship between humanity and technology. My process will use technologies and data as material; chat logs, images, statistics, video footage, and audio. Conditions of the soul, show in data, I will reverse-engineer technologies to form images from the transpersonal world. Details to give form of the formless psychic structures, Phantasmagoria is a 3D-modeled prosthetic which allows the user to enter his or her dream state once asleep in full consciousness. <br> <br>
    To explore the depths the both the individual conscious and collective conscious in the technological world, to reawaken symbols and signs that have been buried under the technological saturation. My method is to dig through data, with the very technology that formed it, after tinkering it I would explore its capabilities to form the numinosum. My inspiration comes from a fear with technology, a reconditioning, a dehumanization, algorithms contextualizing the human psyche. A dissolution of the outside world of form and the individual occurs, fragments float throughout the mythic landscape; data. With my practice, I attempt to make recognition of the numinous at the heart of nature and psyche with these technologies. To meet these forces, in myths. Metaphor, to carry over,</p> -->
