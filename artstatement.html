        <p>My practice concerns itself with exploring the interactions between humans and technology. My artistic process begins with data as the base material.
          The work involves the metaphorical reinterpretation of data drawing most of its emphasis from interaction and design. </p> <p>
          The contemporary world relies on technology as it relies on us to use it. Through your fingertips we explore the world in fragments of data‒‒ the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
          Data as in chat logs, images, statistics, video footage, and audio.
          To frame a technoscape of the world, gathering of fragments, the information where the person is involved in.
          There is a certain richness of data hidden beneath the surface ‒ deeper reality ‒ that could lead to understanding of ourselves. </p>
